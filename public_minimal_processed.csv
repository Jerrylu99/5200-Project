# Card & Krueger (1994) Replication — Phase 1 (ECON 5200)

## Track
Causal Policy Track (Difference-in-Differences)

## Paper
Card, D., & Krueger, A. B. (1994). *Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.* American Economic Review.

## Identification Strategy (2–3 sentences)
This project follows a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design to estimate the effect of New Jersey’s minimum wage increase on fast-food employment, using Pennsylvania as the control group. The key assumption is **parallel trends**: absent the policy, employment outcomes in NJ and PA would have evolved similarly over time.
